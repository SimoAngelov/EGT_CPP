You are the owner of a hardware store and need to
keep an inventory that can tell you what different
tools you have, how many of each you have on
hand and the cost of each one. Write a program
that initializes the random-access file hardware.dat
to 100 empty records, lets you input the data
concerning each tool, enables you to list all your
tools, lets you delete a record for a tool that you no
longer have and lets you update any information in
the file. The tool identification number should be
the record number.
